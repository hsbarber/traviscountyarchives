The post office was discontinued in 1890, and mail for the community was sent to Leander. During the 1940s, two churches, a business, and a few scattered houses marked the community on county highway maps.

Captain Sprinkle had bought a large tract of land in the area and his grandson, William Braxton Barr, developed the family businesses into a small town. By 1890 the town had three churches, a school, a general store, and a population of 100. Most of the families in the area were farmers, and cotton was their principal cash crop. In 1904, the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad was built through the town, helping the residents transport their cotton.</p><p> Soon after, though, the population of the town began to decline. The town suffered the loss of young men and women to a typhoid fever epidemic, to World War I, to the lack of jobs during the Great Depression and the fall of cotton prices during the war. By the early 1930s the population of Sprinkle was at 10 residents.

James Wheat, a former slave from Arkansas, brought his family to the area and founded the community in 1867. In 1869 he bought a plot of land at what is now 2409 San Gabriel Street and  became Wheatville\'s first landowner. Wheat raised corn while many of Wheatville’s residents worked as domestics in white households, merchants in the community, and as semiskilled laborers in the Austin construction industry. A few blacksmiths lived in Wheatville, and some residents farmed and raised livestock. George Franklin, a former slave and a carpenter, purchased land at the site of present-day 2402 San Gabriel in 1869 and constructed a stone building with walls four stones thick. Now known as the Franzetti building, it became the center of the community as subsequent owners used it to house families, grocery stores, various other businesses, and churches. Jacob Fontaine, a Baptist Minister who settled in Wheatville in the 1960s, lived in the Franzetti building with his family periodically from 1875 to 1898. In 1876 he used it for the office of the Austin Gold Dollar, an early black newspaper. In 1881, The Wheatville School opened in the community. W. H. Passon, a prominent black educator in Austin, served on the school staff and later became principal. In 1904 ninety-seven students attended the school.</p><p>Wheatville had about 300 inhabitants at its peak, which was probably around the turn of the century. The community remained relatively isolated until Austin\'s white population began to expand toward the more varied landscape and better drainage offered to the west. Wheatville began gradually changing to a neighborhood of Italian immigrants, and white residents surrounded the community. In 1905 Salvatore Perrone bought the Franzetti building and began operating a grocery store there. In 1928 the city of Austin adopted a plan to locate all public facilities for blacks, presumably schools, recreation facilities, and health clinics, in East Austin. The plan\'s stated purpose was to draw the remaining black inhabitants in western Austin to the east. The Wheatville School closed in 1932, and the community had practically vanished by the mid-1930s. Today, the remaining sign of Wheatville is the stone building at 2402 San Gabriel, which has been declared a historical landmark by the Austin City Council.</p><img src="http://www.traviscountyhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wheatvillesmall.jpg" alt="Wheatville"><br><div class="mapcaption">Wheatville, c. 1900s<br><i>Photo No. PICA 36047, Austin History Center, Austin Public Library</i></div></div>';makeMarker({position:new google.maps.LatLng(30.201648,(-97.834957)),title:"Kincheonville",sidebarItem:"Kincheonville",content:contentString1}),makeMarker({position:new google.maps.LatLng(30.402446,(-97.468419)),title:"Manda",sidebarItem:"Manda",content:contentString2}),makeMarker({position:new google.maps.LatLng(30.449854,(-98.03204)),title:"Mud",sidebarItem:"Mud",content:contentString3}),makeMarker({position:new google.maps.LatLng(30.525712,(-97.927669)),title:"Nameless",sidebarItem:"Nameless",content:contentString4}),makeMarker({position:new google.maps.LatLng(30.352334,(-97.647272)),title:"Sprinkle",sidebarItem:"Sprinkle",content:contentString5}),makeMarker({position:new google.maps.LatLng(30.288554,(-97.747864)),title:"Wheatville",sidebarItem:"Wheatville",content:contentString6}),SidebarItem1.prototype.addIn=function(e){e&&1==e.nodeType?this.div=e:this.div=document.getElementById(e)||document.getElementById("mapsidebar1")||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0],this.div.appendChild(this.button)},SidebarItem1.prototype.remove=function(){return!!this.div&&(this.div.removeChild(this.button),!0)};var contentString6='<div class="window"><h4>Austin-Travis County Tuberculosis Sanatorium</h4><p>Travis County and the City of Austin partnered to open a tubercular camp, located about four miles northeast of Austin. Despite these modest efforts for the treatment of individuals suffering from tuberculosis, in 1921 the Travis County Humane Society issued a plea that more diligent and long-range efforts be taken to prevent the spread of the disease.</p><p>It wasn’t until 1938 that plans for a large-scale treatment facility were put into motion. Sponsored through the efforts of the Austin Women’s Club and the Austin Junior Chamber of Commerce, together with money raised by public donations, county and city appropriations, and a federal grant from the WPA, the Austin-Travis County Tuberculosis Sanatorium officially opened on May 6, 1940.</p><p>The Austin-Travis County Tuberculosis Sanatorium was run jointly by Travis County and the City of Austin. It was governed by a Board of Directors appointed by the County Judge. Located five miles east of Austin on Webberville Road, on a sixteen-acre plot of ground donated by the county, the building had six separate wings, with private rooms and fifty beds to accommodate “white, Mexican, and colored” patients. It provided treatment for all stages of pulmonary tuberculosis and had complete laboratory facilities. Admission to the Sanatorium was limited to citizens of Travis County, but both private (paying) patients and “charity cases” were accepted.</p><p>In the mid-1950s, with operations of the Austin-Travis County Tuberculosis Sanatorium running well below patient capacity, the possible closure of the facility came under discussion. In the end, the facility was not closed for another 15 years, although its services were reduced so that the facility served more as a “holding station” than a hospital, providing treatment to tuberculosis patients only until they could be admitted to one of the State tuberculosis hospitals. In 1970, Austin-Travis County Tuberculosis Sanatorium (by then referred to as Brackenridge Hospital East) was finally closed.</p><img src="http://www.traviscountyhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sanatoriumsmall.jpg" alt="Sanatorium"><br><div class="mapcaption">Austin-Travis County Tuberculosis Sanatorium, 1948<br><i>-Photo No. ND-48-A004-01, Austin History Center, Austin Public Library</i></div></div>',contentString7='<div class="window"><h4>The Reuben Hornsby Home</h4><p>Hornsby Bend, also known as Hornsby or Hornsby\'s, is on Farm Road 969 and the Colorado River, nine miles east of Austin in eastern Travis County.

Its post office was discontinued in 1901, and mail for Hornsby Bend was sent to Austin.  In 1905 the Hornsby Bend schools combined with those of Dunlap to form the Hornsby-Dunlap common school district. The Hornsby-Dunlap district was annexed to the Del Valle Independent School District in 1967.

Those who came or were sent to poor farms were expected to work the land to help support the institution unless physically disabled.</p><p>In 1879, the Travis County Commissioners Court, likely influenced by economic factors, established the Travis County Poor Farm. Former County Commissioner Richard Septimus Young served as the first poor farm superintendent. Initially the farm was located around what is now 51st and Guadalupe/Lamar Streets, and the land totaled just over 200 acres. Over the years, changes in the Travis County population caused the location of the poor farm to be moved several times. Around 1908, the poor farm was relocated to near present-day Tarrytown, just north of Lake Austin Boulevard. The main building at the Poor Farm held the kitchen; a storeroom for supplies, groceries, and clothing; a dining room; and quarters for the staff. Outbuildings included cottages for the elderly and infirm, a separate guarded building for inmates, and a large barn.</p> <p>The onset of the Great Depression and a myriad of federal welfare and relief laws in the 1930s contributed to the decline of the poor farm throughout Texas. Populations at such institutions gradually dropped off as other types of relief were made available. The services offered by the Travis County Poor Farm were discontinued in 1936, and portions of the land were auctioned off in 1939.</p><img
